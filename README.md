We expect to see more and more of this data published as open data or published as an API to users as a service (and we hope so).
There will also be a need for privacy protection to ensure that sensitive information about the source of collection is not leaked when the stored data is used by a third party.

At Apple's WWDC 2016, it was reported that differential privacy is being used, but I think there are still few examples of differential privacy being used specifically.
So we tried differential privacy in Python.
